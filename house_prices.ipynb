    "**Objective:** To accurately predict the final price of homes in Ames, Iowa.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use of Solution**: The solution may be used to predict home prices in Ames, but it is mostly for me to use to experiment, learn and improve my ML skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Solutions**: Experts in real estate give their best estimate of house prices given their knowledge of markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type of Problem**: This is a regression problem that should be solved with offline supervised learning in a model-based approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Measure**: As determined by the Kaggle competition, the performance of the model will be measured by the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error, however while working on the model I will evaluate it with a range of metrics, including the Mean Absolute Error to guage how well the model is performing in real terms of house prices.\n",

Either way it predicts SalePrice very accurately so, whatever the reason for it, we'll keep it. "
